            The mission here is simple. You need to think how to mathematically describe the progression of the column number, based on the fact that you know the letters of this column (the higher the letter, the more letters - the bigger the number will be). Maybe you can somehow convert the letters to an integer...?

            It will be useful for you to read some information about:

            So we need to convert our column letter to an integer. It will look like this.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
name = "A"
print(ord(name))
        </pre>
        <div class="output">
            <p>Output:</p>
            <pre>65</pre>
        </div>
    </div>

            We need the first letter to output 1, not 65. Also, the ord() function can only accept one letter. So let's predict this too, in the case of a line whose length is greater than 1. We will use a <b class="code">while</b> loop, in which we will take one element from the line until the line ends.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
name = "AY"
while name:
    print(ord(name[0]) - 64)
    name = name[1:]
        </pre>
        <div class="output">
            <p>Output:</p>
            <pre>1</pre>
            <pre>25</pre>

            Okay, now it's time to think about the math. If we have one letter in a string - everything is clear, we just return its "value" in the form of an integer. But if there are two or more letters? Let's analyze the two letters "AY" as an example. Since there are two letters, and the first letter is "A", this means that it will have a value of 27, not 1, since it comes after "Z". Next is the letter "Y", it has a value of 25, so we add 27 + 25 and our result.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
name = "AY"
result = 0
while name:
    result += (26 ** (len(name) - 1)) * (ord(name[0]) - 64)
    name = name[1:]
        </pre>
    </div>

            All you have to do is wrap the code in a function expression and return the <b class="code">result</b> value.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def column_number(name: str) -> int:

    result = 0
    while name:
        result += (26 ** (len(name) - 1)) * (ord(name[0]) - 64)
        name = name[1:]
    return result
        </pre>

            Okay, okay! That's the spirit!=) Here is a variant of the solution through the <b class="code">for</b> loop. The mathematical formula is the same.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def column_number(name: str) -> int:

    total = 0
    for i, j in enumerate(name[::-1]):
        total += (ord(j) - 64) * (26 ** i)
    return total
        </pre>
